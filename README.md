This is a simple js app that used the pokeapi to create an interactive pokedex. Pokemon are displayed in a grid and a search bar is available
to find specific pokemon quicly. The background color of each pokemon in the grid represents its primary type while the border color represents
its secondary type. Clicking on a pokemon will pull up additional information about that pokemon from the pokeapi.
